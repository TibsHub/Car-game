# Car-game

Source code of a multiplayer, cross-platform car game written in Java

Cars move according to direction. Speed scale is 0-10.
To adjust speed - accelerate by pressing corresponding up key, down to slow down.

Issues:
- once a car hits the outer edge of track it's very hard/impossible to bring it back to the track
- collision control not yet implemented
 
If a car drives onto the middle area it will slow down and eventually come to a halt.

Control (accelerate, brake, L, R):
P1 => A W S D;
P2 => Arrow keys
